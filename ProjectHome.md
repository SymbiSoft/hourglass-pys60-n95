# Welcome! #

**pyHourglass** is (will be) an open source app written in pyton for s60 that shows an hourglass (a.k.a sand clock, sand timer) that reacts to the accelerometer and will serve as a timer.

Since the N95 sits up on both sides it will be a great app to use when you want a timer (for board games for example).

I have never written anything in python (or any other language for that matter) so this is quite an ambicious project. Any help will be greatly apreciated.

### Features: ###
  * Ability to change the amout of time the hourglass displays (default: 60 seconds)
  * Configurable voice notification when the sand runs out (using text-to-speech)
  * Digital timer will also be displayed (not sure if its possible)
  * Ability to enable/disable the camera view as background image
